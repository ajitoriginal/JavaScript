JavaScript:
    a high level programming language
    one of the core technologies of the world wide web
    can be used to build server side applications
    also used in mobile app development
    also used to create desktop applications
    most popular language according to the 2021 Stack Overflow developer survey

How to run JavaScript:
    Browser
    Node.js runtime

Data Types:
    Primitive - String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol
    Non-Primitive - Objects

Operators:
    a special symbol used to perform operations on values and variables
    Types are:

        Arithmetic : +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
        Comparision : ==, ===, <, >, <=, >=, !=, !==

        Others : Ternary Operator etc. (condition ? true statement : false statement)
    
Type Conversions:
    Implicit Conversion: type coercion where JavaScript itself will automatically convert the type
    Explicit Conversion: where you manually convert the type

Equality:
    == (Allows coercion)
    === (Does not allow coercion)

Conditional Statements:
    If, else, else if, switch

Looping:
    For loop, While loop, Do..while loop, For..of loop

Functions:
    a block of code designed to perform a particular task
    Ex: Add two numbers, multiply two numbers etc.
    reusable as they can be defined once and can be called with different values resulting in different results
    help divide a complex problem into smaller chunks and makes your program easy to understand and maintain

Scope:
    determines the accessibility or visibility of variables
    Block scope, Function scope, Global scope
